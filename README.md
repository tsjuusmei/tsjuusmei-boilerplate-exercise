# Next boilerplate

This is Yummygum's [Next.js](https://www.nextjs.org) boilerplate.

To commit use `npm run commit`, this will open up the commitizen CLI tool.

To release a new version we have to use `npm run release`. We should be able to easily automate this by integrating a CI tool to run `npm run release` & running: `git push --follow-tags origin BRANCH_NAME`
